        <h2>NLP Research</h2>
        <p>
            I spent the latter two years of my undergraduate degree working on NLP research in <a href="http://www.ark.cs.washington.edu/index.html">Noah's ARK</a>.
            My undergraduate experience prompted me to pursue a master's with a focus on NLP research in the same group.
            This was, by far, the <em>best</em> experience during my time at UW.
        </p>

        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <h3>Facebook</h3>
        <p>
            I interned twice at Facebook (Fall 2018 and Summer 2019) and worked on a variety of NLP projects
            on the <b>Messenger Assistant</b> and <b>Newsfeed Integrity</b> Teams. Work from my first internship project was published
            at <a href="https://www.emnlp-ijcnlp2019.org/program/accepted/">EMNLP 2019</a> and a project from my second internship was pushed to production.
        </p>
        <h3>Microsoft</h3>
        <p>
            I interned twice at Microsoft, first as an Explorer Intern in 2016 and then as a Software Engineering Intern in 2018.
            Both internships were on different teams in Azure &mdash; <b>Security</b> and <b>Customer Experience Engineering (CXP)</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Blue Origin</h3>
        <p>
            I spent one summer pursuing my childhood dream to work at a rocket company.
            My work was focused on internal tooling, but I spent several hours marveling at the
            <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/engines/be-4">BE-4</a> engine and <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/new-shepard/">New Shepard</a>
            rocket on the factory floor.
            I wrote about my experience <a href="https://medium.com/@karishma.mandyam/three-insights-from-ten-weeks-at-a-rocket-company-b8b970e6afdd">here</a>.

            Sometimes I enjoy writing blog posts about my life, and other experiences.
            I publish them <a href="https://medium.com/@karishma.mandyam">here</a>. So far, I've written two
            end-of-year summaries (<a href="https://medium.com/@karishma.mandyam/what-happened-in-the-last-525-600-minutes-4183fd7f6cb1">2018</a>,

        <h2>Other Pursuits</h2>
        <p>
            I spent the majority of my life learning classical Indian dance. This experience resulted in
            some time on <a href="https://natyauw.weebly.com/">UW's classical Indian dance team</a> and
            directing a classical competition, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laasya2019">Laasya 2019</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally, I dabble in some <em>very</em> amateur photography.
            I publish my favorite ones <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kayrishmatic_photography/">here</a>.
